# Description

In the base code's **XAML**, there are **two elements**, one of them is a **Checkbox**, while the other is a **Label**.

**Your task** is to bind the Checkbox's `IsChecked` property with the Label's `Text` property such that, when the Checkbox is checked, it sets the Label to "Is checkbox checked? True" and if it's not then the Label is set to "Is checkbox checked? False".

**You only have to modify the C# file.**
